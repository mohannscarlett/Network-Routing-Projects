This activity is done in packet tracer to simulate a controller-based WLAN development. This includes having
a corporate network with a WLC and AAA server to handle wireless access point authentication, a home
network, ISP network, and external (web) network.
Objectives

• Create a network topology to demonstrate a controller-based WLAN development.
• Enable routing throughout the network, using OSPF.
• Configure devices to appropriate settings to ensure security.
• Ensure connected end user devices can contact the external web server.
